Train Time
A train timing app

Purpose:
This app was created to demonstrate the functionality to dynamically add a custom train to the schedule and the logic to display when that train will arrive.

How it works:
I used jQuery and Javascript to take in the new train info and push it to Firebase to store the info. That new train info is then pulled out of the database and appended to the table.

How to use:
Start by adding a Train Name, Destination, Time when the first train will arrive and how often(Frequency) the train will arrive. Click the submit button and watch the table update with your train and the time it will arrive.

Functionality to add:
I would like to add a button for each train created to delete that train if desired.
